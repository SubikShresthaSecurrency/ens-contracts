# ENS Instructions

#### We have couple of scripts for running the ENS registering and resolving a name process.

#### Currently the file in scripts/demo.ts is the most complete

To execute scripts/demo.ts - first we run:

#### Ganache Local Network

And then,

`npx hardhat run scripts/demo.ts --network localhost`

#### Please look at the scripts/demo.ts file for more detailed explanation on how the steps are being taken to register names and how reverse registrar are used to resolve an address back to the name
